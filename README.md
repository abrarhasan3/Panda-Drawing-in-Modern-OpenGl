## Features

- **Modern OpenGL (3.3):** Utilizes the modern OpenGL framework for efficient rendering.
- **Shader Programs:** Implements vertex and fragment shaders to achieve realistic lighting and shading effects.
- **Texture Mapping:** Applies texture mapping to enhance the visual representation of the panda.
- **User Interaction:** Provides interactive controls to manipulate the view and zoom into the panda image.
- **Cross-Platform:** Designed to work seamlessly across different platforms.

<li>At first 957 points are taken to draw the outlines. The dataset would be found in Default Dataset 11.csv file. 
To extract the point following website is used:
